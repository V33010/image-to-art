# ASCII Art Converter

The ASCII Art Converter is a Python program that allows users to convert images into ASCII art. It utilizes the powerful capabilities of the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and provides an interactive interface for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- Image Selection: Users can enter the name of the image file they want to convert into ASCII art. The program displays the image for confirmation before proceeding.

- Image Resizing: Users have the option to resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. The program recommends keeping the largest dimension below 180 for optimal results.

- ASCII Art Generation: The program converts the image's pixels into corresponding ASCII characters, creating visually appealing representations of the image.

- File Saving: A file-saving mechanism is incorporated, enabling users to export the generated ASCII art as a text file. This allows for easy preservation and sharing of the unique creations.

- User-Friendly Interface: The program utilizes a clear terminal functionality for improved readability and provides informative messages throughout the conversion process.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the program by executing the Python script:
   ```
   python art.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the image file name, adjust dimensions, confirm the image display, and save the ASCII art to a text file.

4. Enjoy exploring the world of ASCII art and sharing your creative masterpieces!

## Dependencies

- Pillow: Used for image manipulation and resizing.
- NumPy: Utilized for efficient handling of image pixel data.
